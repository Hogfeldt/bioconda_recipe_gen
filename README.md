# Bioconda Recipe Gen (BiRG)
BiRG is a tool for generating recipes for Bioconda.

## Documentation
The documentation for BiRG can be found [here](https://birg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
This is also where you can find: **installation guide** and **tutorial to get started**.

## When to use BiRG
If you already have a package on PyPI, then it is recommended to simply use `conda skeleton`. 
A guide to this can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html).

Otherwise, BiRG is a way to automatically generate the conda recipe for your software that is needed for building a conda package.
